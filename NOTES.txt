VRP code reference:

Simulate data: given distribution simulate client arrivals, demands and their time-windows in days (4-5 days)

Optimization problem:
    Calculate Euclidean distances between client
        - maybe some couples of distances can be not saved if they are too high
        - fill in adjacency matrix -> start with a symmetric one
    Select which customer to serve
        - 300 new customers per day -> OK
        - max number of deliveries to respect capacity constraint and time constraint -> capacity constraint OK
        - look at probability of other near customers in future
        - Each customer has demand expressed in: m^3, set up time (related to set up cost), kg, available day -> OK
    Solve VRP for those customers
        - objectives: mean distances, stoking times
        - beware the set-up times, fixed costs
        - capacity and time constraint
        - fixed number of available vehicles (50-60 vehicles)

TO DO:
2_ Improve VRP (WIP):
    - set maximum time for search -> done (30s)
    - set maximum number of costumer per vehicle -> done
    - set maximum lenght of each route -> done
    - set capacity constraint -> done
    - set time constraint -> WIP: I'm assuming vehicles with 60km/h velocities
    - set all cost in objective function
3_ Work on num_deliveries
