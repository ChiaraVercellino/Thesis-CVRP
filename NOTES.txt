VRP code reference:

Simulate data: given distribution simulate client arrivals, demands and their time-windows in days (4-5 days)

Optimization problem:
    Select which customer to serve
        - 400 new customers per day 
        - max number of deliveries to respect capacity constraint and time constraint
        - look at probability of other near customers in future
        - Each customer has demand expressed in: set up time (related to set up cost), kg, available day
    Solve VRP for those customers
        - set maximum time for VRP solver: 30 sec
        - set maximum number of costumers per vehicle: 5 customers
        - set maximum total time of each route: 480 min (8 h)
        - set capacity constraint per vehicle: 1000 kg
        - I'm assuming vehicles with 60km/h velocities
        - objective function: minimize total travel and set up times and number of vehicles
        OBS: ortools work with integer objective function

TO DO:
1_ Implement new policy
2_ Make code work also with other policies for customers selection

Usage: vrp_ej.exe -f vrp_file -j num_ejected -t num_trials -m method [-s sol_file -out out_file -n num_heur_sols -v]
         num_ejected should be something less than 20 or so
         num_trials can be fairly large as the procedure is fast (say 1000)
         method must be 0 (RANDOM search), 1 (REGRET search)
         Options:
         Can start with a solution in sol_file or it will generate an initial
            solution for you
         Can write the final best solution discovered to out_file
         Adding -v will print verbose output
Usage: vrp_init.exe -f vrp_file -m method [-c]
         method should be 0 for CW, 1 for Sweep
         If -c option is given, then all routes are cleaned up at the end
                 by running intra-route improvements
